# The Future of Relay(?)

This repo is a showcase for experimental code and APIs that we're thinking about for the future of [Relay](https://github.com/facebook/relay). They are not necessarily implemented or agreed on. We're doing this in order to provide greater transparency into our long-term development process, beyond what we've been sharing in our [Roadmap](https://github.com/facebook/relay/tree/master/meta/roadmaps) and [Meeting Notes](https://github.com/facebook/relay/tree/master/meta/meeting-notes).

Credit for the idea of having a "-future" repo goes to [react-future](https://github.com/reactjs/react-future).
